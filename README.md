# World Weather Analysis
Using OpenWeather, Google Maps API, Python, and the gmaps Python package to build a vacation itinerary selection app

## Overview of Analysis


## Resources
Software: Python 3.8.6, Jupyter Notebook

Python packages: citipy, gmaps, requests, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, datetime

APIs: OpenWeatherMap, Google Maps

## Building the App

### Creating the Weather Database



### Creating a Customer Travel Destinations Map


### Creating a Travel Itinerary Map




## Summary

In my opinion, a similar method could be used on the backend to build an app that would allow end-users to narrow down their vacation options and itineraries. My only suggestion would be to use a more curated list of cities instead of choosing them randomly based on latitude and longitude.
